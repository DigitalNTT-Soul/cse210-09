# Cycle
Cycle is a clone of the Tron cycle game Cycle. There are two cycles, and the object is not to run into the path of the other cycle. Cycle 1 is controlled with W (up), A (left), D (Right) and S (Down). The second cycle is controlled with I (up), J (left), L (Right) and K (Down).


## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
python3 -m pip install pygame

```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 cycle
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- cycle               (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
  +-- config.py         (config for for game constants)
  +-- constants.py      (constants for the game)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
